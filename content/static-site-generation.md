This website was born out of a desire to try something new to me: web development.

Make no mistake, there is no shortage of tools that make it easy and simple to create a website, like Squarespace,
Weebly, and Wordpress. I immediately discounted these as it defeated the whole point of delving into web development.

I was initially daunted by the prospect of writing an entire website, CSS and all, from scratch. After expressing these
concerns to a friend, I was introduced to the notion of 'static site generation', something I have started to
(possibly inaccurately) refer to as a 'templating system'. Although there are [many](https://www.staticgen.com/) of these
services already in existence, I wanted to make my own.
