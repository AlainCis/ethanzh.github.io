My first semester as a college student has been busy in several different ways.
Adjusting to lecture-style classes, having more difficult coursework, and
living away from home have all been challenging in different ways.

On the surface, summer internships appear to be the great divide,
especially amongst freshman, essentially dividing the "haves" and the "have nots".

In this article I hope to detail my own experience with navigating the
recruiting process in order to demystify much of the myths and heresy you may read.

Firstly, I feel it necessary to say that UT does a good job of setting expectations,
especially for freshmen when it comes to getting internships for the summer. The fact of the
matter is that it's simply a large risk for a company to take a chance on a freshman given
the vast array of skill levels (which tends to converge as the years go on). In addition,
hiring freshman isn't conducive to these company's goals to create a 'pipeline', wherein
they can extend job offers to students directly following their internships.
