                    <p>For the first 18 years of my life, I've been lucky enough to have been able to experience the two main types of schools in
my K-12 years. I'll start by giving a brief overview of my experience in each, and then go into the more specific differences,
and ultimately what my opinion on choosing between the two is.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="Graphic" src="https://articles.niche.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/private-vs-public-schools.png" /></p>
<p>Right off the bat, I should probably note that I have never attended the kind of private school you may be thinking of. All of the
'private' schools I have gone to have been international schools, which by definition are private, but also serve a broader purpose.</p>
<p>I began my schooling career at <a target="_blank" href="http://bism.bladins.se/">Bladins</a> International School in Malmo, Sweden. It was only for about a month,
so I don't really have too much to add on.</p>
<p>From the second month of kindergarten to halfway through 4th grade, I attended a public elementary school in The Woodlands, Texas. This was still
quite a while ago, so I don't have a whole lot to reflect on now. Maybe the one lasting impression I have is that (according to Facebook), many of my friends
from this time are now <em>heavily</em> involved in the school marching band, but I really think that's more of a Texas thing than a public/private school thing.</p>
<h3>Private schools</h3>
<p>Now to the more interesting part (i.e. the periods of my life that I remember with full clarity). I finished elementary school, and did the entirety of middle
school at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oslointernationalschool.no/">Oslo International School</a>. This school is <em>small</em>, with my entire grade being comprised of around 40 students.
For some, having such a small class size could seem claustrophobic at times. The positive of this small environment is that you get to know everyone around you
really well. The downside is you get to know everyone <em>really</em> well. As a student at OIS, I never had too much of a choice with regards to my course selection, with
my only real choices being the foreign language in addition to Norwegian (I chose Spanish).</p>
<p>Each grade was structured so that there were around three 'contact' classes (think of this as homeroom). In traditional Norwegian fashion, we stayed in these groups for
all of our classes (except foreign language). These groups changed every year, however Norwegian schools typically go all twelve years with the same homeroom classes. OIS was truly an international school,
with around a quarter of the students being Norwegian, and the remaining three-quarters coming from all over the world, from countries such as South Africa, Australia, Trinidad, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>OIS, being a private school, had some very nice facilities, but it was also somewhat rough around the edges. My lasting legacy was messing up a chemistry experiment that burned a hole in
the ground, and as of June 2017 (3 years after the incident), the hole is still there. Even though it's a private school, it's a private school in one of the most expensive countries in the
world to get things done. That being said, its location in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/W.%20B.%20Samson%20-%20Bekkestua%20pizza%20near%20stabekk%20akershus%20norway/@59.9174764,10.5872009,21z?hl=en">Bekkestua</a> could not have been
more convenient for a middle-schooler.</p>
<p>What I maybe miss the most about the school were the week-long, multi-grade excursions that we would take every year. Although we always stayed within Norway, we got the chance to ski in the mountains, sail on the fjords, and hike through
the forests. Norway's nature-centric viewpoint definitely shined through these trips.</p>
<p>During the summer between 8th and 9th grade, I moved from OIS to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb.bj.edu.cn/">ISB</a>, the International School of Beijing. ISB was a different beast entirely from OIS, and I really had
no idea what to expect. The first obvious difference was I had a school-appointed 'peer-helper' to chat with before I even arrived in Beijing. I was able to ask her any questions about the school,
or China in general. In my opinion, this was super helpful and conducive towards an easy transition to a totally new country.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="OIS vs ISB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/schools.png" /></p>
<p>ISB has over 3 times as many students as OIS, and well over 3 times the footprint. The campus is huge, almost like a small university. The size of my grade almost tripled to around 110, but interestingly, my actual class sizes
seemed to stay the same size, and some even shrunk (I had 4 students in my Chinese class at one point). This is (somewhat obviously) because we as students had far more choice with regards to
the choices we could take. This freedom allowed me to take electives in photography and film, two things I probably never would have discovered if not for these electives. This was a private school, and it showed. Every teacher
was passionate about their subject <em>and</em> great at teaching it. The facilities, whether it be the film room, weight room, gymnasiums, or photography studios, were all top-notch. We as students were also allowed free-reign over
these facilities, we never had to book-ahead or make reservations.</p>
<p>ISB, despite still being an international school, was far less international than OIS. An overwhelming majority of the class was Chinese (or Chinese-American/Chinese-Canadian) and Korean. There were only a small number of
expats in a similar situation as me, and most of them were in Beijing because their parents worked for the United States embassy.</p>
<p>I no longer got to go on week-long trips with my whole grade, but what I now had the opportunity to go on international sports trips. Scandinavian international schools <em>do</em> go on sports trips, but it's only once a year, and it
normally involved a 8-hour bus trip each way. Sports trips at Asian international schools are on a whole 'nother level. We would almost always fly, whether it be to Shanghai, or all the way down to Manilla. One of my favorite aspects of
these trips was that we didn't stay in hotel rooms, we instead had a 'homestay' system. Essentially, me and a team mate would sleep on someone from the host team's floor. It sounds unglamorous, and sometimes it was, but it was a great way to
meet new people from different schools around the continent.</p>
<p>School wasn't easy here. For the first time in my life I actually had to study for tests. If you look at my high school transcript, it's quite obvious that 9th grade me took some time to get used to this. Ultimately,
I think it is very valuable that I had to learn <em>how</em> to study. It's a lot better to have to learn that in high school than in university. At OIS school was relatively nonchalant, and there wasn't really a drive to
do well unless that drive came from yourself. For better or for worse, that drive is externalized at ISB, but in a healthy way. Even though we would help each other study, most of us always had 'the curve' at the back
of our minds. It was all in good spirit, though.</p>
<p>I could go on much, much longer about the upsides of the International School of Beijing. It pushed me academically, while also giving me the freedom to follow what I was really interested in. However, this blog post
would be nothing without the other side.</p>
