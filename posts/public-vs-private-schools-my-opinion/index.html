                    <p>For the first 18 years of my life, I've been lucky enough to have been able to experience the two main types of schools in
my K-12 years. I'll start by giving a brief overview of my experience in each, and then go into the more specific differences,
and ultimately what my opinion on choosing between the two is.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="Graphic" src="https://articles.niche.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/private-vs-public-schools.png" /></p>
<p>Right off the bat, I should probably note that I have never attended the kind of private school you may be thinking of. All of the
'private' schools I have gone to have been international schools, which by definition are private, but also serve a broader purpose.</p>
<p>I began my schooling career at <a target="_blank" href="http://bism.bladins.se/">Bladins</a> International School in Malmo, Sweden. It was only for about a month,
so I don't really have too much to add on.</p>
<p>From the second month of kindergarten to halfway through 4th grade, I attended a public elementary school in The Woodlands, Texas. This was still
quite a while ago, so I don't have a whole lot to reflect on now. Maybe the one lasting impression I have is that (according to Facebook), many of my friends
from this time are now <em>heavily</em> involved in the school marching band, but I really think that's more of a Texas thing than a public/private school thing.</p>
<h3>Private schools</h3>
<p>Now to the more interesting part (i.e. the periods of my life that I remember with full clarity). I finished elementary school, and did the entirety of middle
school at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oslointernationalschool.no/">Oslo International School</a>. This school is <em>small</em>, with my entire grade being comprised of around 40 students.
For some, having such a small class size could seem claustrophobic at times. The positive of this small environment is that you get to know everyone around you
really well. The downside is you get to know everyone <em>really</em> well. As a student at OIS, I never had too much of a choice with regards to my course selection, with
my only real choices being the foreign language in addition to Norwegian (I chose Spanish).</p>
<p>Each grade was structured so that there were around three 'contact' classes (think of this as homeroom). In traditional Norwegian fashion, we stayed in these groups for
all of our classes (except foreign language). These groups changed every year, however Norwegian schools typically go all twelve years with the same homeroom classes. OIS was truly an international school,
with around a quarter of the students being Norwegian, and the remaining three-quarters coming from all over the world, from countries such as South Africa, Australia, Trinidad, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>OIS, being a private school, had some very nice facilities, but it was also somewhat rough around the edges. My lasting legacy was messing up a chemistry experiment that burned a hole in
the ground, and as of June 2017 (3 years after the incident), the hole is still there. Even though it's a private school, it's a private school in one of the most expensive countries in the
world to get things done. That being said, its location in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/W.%20B.%20Samson%20-%20Bekkestua%20pizza%20near%20stabekk%20akershus%20norway/@59.9174764,10.5872009,21z?hl=en">Bekkestua</a> could not have been
more convenient for a middle-schooler.</p>
<p>What I maybe miss the most about the school were the week-long, multi-grade excursions that we would take every year. Although we always stayed within Norway, we got the chance to ski in the mountains, sail on the fjords, and hike through
the forests. Norway's nature-centric viewpoint definitely shined through these trips.</p>
<p>During the summer between 8th and 9th grade, I moved from OIS to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb.bj.edu.cn/">ISB</a>, the International School of Beijing. ISB was a different beast entirely from OIS, and I really had
no idea what to expect. The first obvious difference was I had a school-appointed 'peer-helper' to chat with before I even arrived in Beijing. I was able to ask her any questions about the school,
or China in general. In my opinion, this was super helpful and conducive towards an easy transition to a totally new country.</p>
