                    <p>For the first 18 years of my life, I've been lucky enough to have been able to experience the two main types of schools in
my K-12 years. I'll start by giving a brief overview of my experience in each, and then go into the more specific differences,
and ultimately what my opinion on choosing between the two is.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="Graphic" src="https://articles.niche.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/private-vs-public-schools.png" /></p>
<p>Right off the bat, I should probably note that I have never attended the kind of private school you may be thinking of. All of the
'private' schools I have gone to have been international schools, which by definition are private, but also serve a broader purpose.</p>
<p>I began my schooling career at <a target="_blank" href="http://bism.bladins.se/">Bladins</a> International School in Malmo, Sweden. It was only for about a month,
so I don't really have too much to add on.</p>
<p>From the second month of kindergarten to halfway through 4th grade, I attended a public elementary school in The Woodlands, Texas. This was still
quite a while ago, so I don't have a whole lot to reflect on now. Maybe the one lasting impression I have is that (according to Facebook), many of my friends
from this time are now <em>heavily</em> involved in the school marching band, but I really think that's more of a Texas thing than a public/private school thing.</p>
<h3>Private Schools</h3>
<p>Now to the more interesting part (i.e. the periods of my life that I remember with full clarity). I finished elementary school, and did the entirety of middle
school at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oslointernationalschool.no/">Oslo International School</a>. This school is <em>small</em>, with my entire grade being comprised of around 40 students.
For some, having such a small class size could seem claustrophobic at times. The positive of this small environment is that you get to know everyone around you
really well. The downside is you get to know everyone <em>really</em> well. As a student at OIS, I never had too much of a choice with regards to my course selection, with
my only real choices being the foreign language in addition to Norwegian (I chose Spanish).</p>
<p>Each grade was structured so that there were around three 'contact' classes (think of this as homeroom). In traditional Norwegian fashion, we stayed in these groups for
all of our classes (except foreign language). These groups changed every year, however Norwegian schools typically go all twelve years with the same homeroom classes. OIS was truly an international school,
with around a quarter of the students being Norwegian, and the remaining three-quarters coming from all over the world, from countries such as South Africa, Australia, Trinidad, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>OIS, being a private school, had some very nice facilities, but it was also somewhat rough around the edges. My lasting legacy was messing up a chemistry experiment that burned a hole in
the ground, and as of June 2017 (3 years after the incident), the hole is still there. Even though it's a private school, it's a private school in one of the most expensive countries in the
world to get things done. That being said, its location in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/W.%20B.%20Samson%20-%20Bekkestua%20pizza%20near%20stabekk%20akershus%20norway/@59.9174764,10.5872009,21z?hl=en">Bekkestua</a> could not have been
more convenient for a middle-schooler.</p>
<p>What I maybe miss the most about the school were the week-long, multi-grade excursions that we would take every year. Although we always stayed within Norway, we got the chance to ski in the mountains, sail on the fjords, and hike through
the forests. Norway's nature-centric viewpoint definitely shined through these trips.</p>
<p>During the summer between 8th and 9th grade, I moved from OIS to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb.bj.edu.cn/">ISB</a>, the International School of Beijing. ISB was a different beast entirely from OIS, and I really had
no idea what to expect. The first obvious difference was I had a school-appointed 'peer-helper' to chat with before I even arrived in Beijing. I was able to ask her any questions about the school,
or China in general. In my opinion, this was super helpful and conducive towards an easy transition to a totally new country.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="OIS vs ISB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/schools.png" /></p>
<p>ISB has over 3 times as many students as OIS, and well over 3 times the footprint. The campus is huge, almost like a small university. The size of my grade almost tripled to around 110, but interestingly, my actual class sizes
seemed to stay the same size, and some even shrunk (I had 4 students in my Chinese class at one point). This is (somewhat obviously) because we as students had far more choice with regards to
the choices we could take. This freedom allowed me to take electives in photography and film, two things I probably never would have discovered if not for these electives. This was a private school, and it showed. Every teacher
was passionate about their subject <em>and</em> great at teaching it. The facilities, whether it be the film room, weight room, gymnasiums, or photography studios, were all top-notch. We as students were also allowed free-reign over
these facilities, we never had to book-ahead or make reservations.</p>
<p>ISB, despite still being an international school, was far less international than OIS. An overwhelming majority of the class was Chinese (or Chinese-American/Chinese-Canadian) and Korean. There were only a small number of
expats in a similar situation as me, and most of them were in Beijing because their parents worked for the United States embassy.</p>
<p>I no longer got to go on week-long trips with my whole grade, but what I now had the opportunity to go on international sports trips. Scandinavian international schools <em>do</em> go on sports trips, but it's only once a year, and it
normally involved a 8-hour bus trip each way. Sports trips at Asian international schools are on a whole 'nother level. We would almost always fly, whether it be to Shanghai, or all the way down to Manilla. One of my favorite aspects of
these trips was that we didn't stay in hotel rooms, we instead had a 'homestay' system. Essentially, me and a team mate would sleep on someone from the host team's floor. It sounds unglamorous, and sometimes it was, but it was a great way to
meet new people from different schools around the continent.</p>
<p>School wasn't easy here. For the first time in my life I actually had to study for tests. If you look at my high school transcript, it's quite obvious that 9th grade me took some time to get used to this. Ultimately,
I think it is very valuable that I had to learn <em>how</em> to study. It's a lot better to have to learn that in high school than in university. At OIS school was relatively nonchalant, and there wasn't really a drive to
do well unless that drive came from yourself. For better or for worse, that drive is externalized at ISB, but in a healthy way. Even though we would help each other study, most of us always had 'the curve' at the back
of our minds. It was all in good spirit, though.</p>
<p>I could go on much, much longer about the upsides of the International School of Beijing. It pushed me academically, while also giving me the freedom to follow what I was really interested in. However, this blog post
would be nothing without the other side.</p>
<h3>Public School</h3>
<p>This summer I moved from Beijing, China to Palo Alto, California. This move was super unexpected, I found out I was moving after school had already let out for the summer. It took around 5 days for the decision to be finalized, and I was
in California later that same month. One of the implications of this move would be transitioning from the international schools which I had grown so accustomed to, to a public American high school.</p>
<p>Public American high schools were spoken of at my time as ISB of places any of us would struggle to function. From the higher class sizes, to more competitive sports teams, they couldn't be more different. Now, public high schools come in all shapes
and sizes, just like the international school's I've been to. My views may be a bit skewed as I attend Gunn High School, which probably isn't representative of the average public school (Gunn is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-public-high-schools/s/california/">ranked number 1</a>
in California).</p>
<p>ISB is very, very predominately Asian (~95%). Gunn isn't quite there, but Asian/Asian-Americans comprise around 40-50% of the student body, making them almost a majority. This didn't take so much
getting used to after ISB, but I've noticed a few subtle differences. The biggest being the difference in pronunciation of Chinese last names (such as Zhou being pronounced 'zao' instead of 'joe').</p>
<p>My class sizes now are much larger, with 32 person classes not being too out of the ordinary. This took me a while to get used to (last year my Chinese class had four people). The lack of teacher-student
interaction is definitely apparent, and it's simply a different learning environment. Asking questions is still possible, but getting lots of 1-1 time with the teacher is almost impossible.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="AP vs IB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/apib.jpg" /></p>
<p>I've also noticed that although AP is meant to be the IB's domestic counterpart, things are taught in a very different way. One of my main complains about AP Economics earlier this year was the testing style -
everything is multiple choice. In theory this should make it easier to study, but it ended up making me feel claustrophobic in a way, because there's no way to justify your answer if it doesn't match the letter
on the answer key.</p>
<p>There is almost a much heavier emphasis on rote memorization in the American school system, from what I've seen. What this results in is students who cram material before tests, just to have it all leave their brains
after whatever test/quiz they were studying for. I've found that I much prefer the IB's emphasis on discussion, and really <em>learning</em> the content, not just memorizing it.</p>
<p>Both Gunn and ISB are competitive environments, there's no doubt about that. However, I've found that students at Gunn (on average) seem to be under more stress (the source of which I can
only speculate, but I wouldn't rule parents out). Compare this to ISB where students are undoubtedly also pressured academically, however I think much more of that comes from within, rather than external forces.</p>
<p>With regard to the athletics aspect, I've found that although Gunn is an American public school, athletics aren't exactly on the top of everyone's mind. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that
football, the most popular high school sport, is a no-cut sport (meaning anyone can be on the team), whereas sports like badminton have stiff competition to make the squad. Sports practices also last for around 3 hours a day,
every weekday which was a big change for me, because ISB sports practices only take around two and a half hours a day, three days a week.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="I got to play football at Gunn" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/fball.jpg" /></p>
<p>If I had to pick between Gunn and ISB, it would be tough. ISB definitely has nicer facilities and a tighter-knit community, but Gunn has the advantage of being much larger, making it easier to explore any
somewhat unconventional interests you may have. Relating to this, Gunn is a much, much better school for anything involving technology (I guess this isn't much of a surprise, seeing as it's located smack-dab in
Silicon Valley). ISB's only programming course (as far as I'm aware) is 'Web Design for Clients', which I've been told isn't the most extensive course in the world. Gunn has an entire Computer Science pathway in the
course guide, but I've found that students I've met are by far the most valuable resource in terms of all things computer science. Any question I can't answer by Googling can be quickly resolved by one of the many
people I know. This has been especially helpful in my foray into machine learning (and web design, as evidenced by this site's existence).</p>
<h3>University and Beyond</h3>
<p>Although I have not received my college decisions yet, the question of private vs public universities still looms in my mind. The University of California system has the obvious advantage (to me) of being in California,
as well as being coupled with in-state tuition. However, this comes at the expense of an over-crowded university, and limited opportunity to really get to know your professors until later years. Private universities on the other hand,
although much more expensive, place a heavier emphasis on the undergraduate experience, as well as generally nicer campuses. Of course, take all of this with a grain of salt because this is all just what I've read and heard from
other people, I haven't really had the opportunity to find these things out for myself (yet).</p>
