                    <p>For the first 18 years of my life, I've been lucky enough to have been able to experience the two main types of schools in
my K-12 years. I'll start by giving a brief overview of my experience in each, and then go into the more specific differences,
and ultimately what my opinion on choosing between the two is.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="Graphic" src="https://articles.niche.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/private-vs-public-schools.png" /></p>
<p>Right off the bat, I should probably note that I have never attended the kind of private school you may be thinking of. All of the
'private' schools I have gone to have been international schools, which by definition are private, but also serve a broader purpose.</p>
<p>I began my schooling career at <a target="_blank" href="http://bism.bladins.se/">Bladins</a> International School in Malmo, Sweden. It was only for about a month,
so I don't really have too much to add on.</p>
<p>From the second month of kindergarten to halfway through 4th grade, I attended a public elementary school in The Woodlands, Texas. This was still
quite a while ago, so I don't have a whole lot to reflect on now. Maybe the one lasting impression I have is that (according to Facebook), many of my friends
from this time are now <em>heavily</em> involved in the school marching band, but I really think that's more of a Texas thing than a public/private school thing.</p>
<h3>Private Schools</h3>
<p>Now to the more interesting part (i.e. the periods of my life that I remember with full clarity). I finished elementary school, and did the entirety of middle
school at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oslointernationalschool.no/">Oslo International School</a>. This school is <em>small</em>, with my entire grade being comprised of around 40 students.
For some, having such a small class size could seem claustrophobic at times. The positive of this small environment is that you get to know everyone around you
really well. The downside is you get to know everyone <em>really</em> well. As a student at OIS, I never had too much of a choice with regards to my course selection, with
my only real choices being the foreign language in addition to Norwegian (I chose Spanish).</p>
<p>Each grade was structured so that there were around three 'contact' classes (think of this as homeroom). In traditional Norwegian fashion, we stayed in these groups for
all of our classes (except foreign language). These groups changed every year, however Norwegian schools typically go all twelve years with the same homeroom classes. OIS was truly an international school,
with around a quarter of the students being Norwegian, and the remaining three-quarters coming from all over the world, from countries such as South Africa, Australia, Trinidad, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>OIS, being a private school, had some very nice facilities, but it was also somewhat rough around the edges. My lasting legacy was messing up a chemistry experiment that burned a hole in
the ground, and as of June 2017 (3 years after the incident), the hole is still there. Even though it's a private school, it's a private school in one of the most expensive countries in the
world to get things done. That being said, its location in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/W.%20B.%20Samson%20-%20Bekkestua%20pizza%20near%20stabekk%20akershus%20norway/@59.9174764,10.5872009,21z?hl=en">Bekkestua</a> could not have been
more convenient for a middle-schooler.</p>
<p>What I maybe miss the most about the school were the week-long, multi-grade excursions that we would take every year. Although we always stayed within Norway, we got the chance to ski in the mountains, sail on the fjords, and hike through
the forests. Norway's nature-centric viewpoint definitely shined through these trips.</p>
<p>During the summer between 8th and 9th grade, I moved from OIS to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb.bj.edu.cn/">ISB</a>, the International School of Beijing. ISB was a different beast entirely from OIS, and I really had
no idea what to expect. The first obvious difference was I had a school-appointed 'peer-helper' to chat with before I even arrived in Beijing. I was able to ask her any questions about the school,
or China in general. In my opinion, this was super helpful and conducive towards an easy transition to a totally new country.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="OIS vs ISB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/schools.png" /></p>
<p>ISB has over 3 times as many students as OIS, and well over 3 times the footprint. The campus is huge, almost like a small university. The size of my grade almost tripled to around 110, but interestingly, my actual class sizes
seemed to stay the same size, and some even shrunk (I had 4 students in my Chinese class at one point). This is (somewhat obviously) because we as students had far more choice with regards to
the choices we could take. This freedom allowed me to take electives in photography and film, two things I probably never would have discovered if not for these electives. This was a private school, and it showed. Every teacher
was passionate about their subject <em>and</em> great at teaching it. The facilities, whether it be the film room, weight room, gymnasiums, or photography studios, were all top-notch. We as students were also allowed free-reign over
these facilities, we never had to book-ahead or make reservations.</p>
<p>ISB, despite still being an international school, was far less international than OIS. An overwhelming majority of the class was Chinese (or Chinese-American/Chinese-Canadian) and Korean. There were only a small number of
expats in a similar situation as me, and most of them were in Beijing because their parents worked for the United States embassy.</p>
<p>I no longer got to go on week-long trips with my whole grade, but what I now had the opportunity to go on international sports trips. Scandinavian international schools <em>do</em> go on sports trips, but it's only once a year, and it
normally involved a 8-hour bus trip each way. Sports trips at Asian international schools are on a whole 'nother level. We would almost always fly, whether it be to Shanghai, or all the way down to Manilla. One of my favorite aspects of
these trips was that we didn't stay in hotel rooms, we instead had a 'homestay' system. Essentially, me and a team mate would sleep on someone from the host team's floor. It sounds unglamorous, and sometimes it was, but it was a great way to
meet new people from different schools around the continent.</p>
<p>School wasn't easy here. For the first time in my life I actually had to study for tests. If you look at my high school transcript, it's quite obvious that 9th grade me took some time to get used to this. Ultimately,
I think it is very valuable that I had to learn <em>how</em> to study. It's a lot better to have to learn that in high school than in university. At OIS school was relatively nonchalant, and there wasn't really a drive to
do well unless that drive came from yourself. For better or for worse, that drive is externalized at ISB, but in a healthy way. Even though we would help each other study, most of us always had 'the curve' at the back
of our minds. It was all in good spirit, though.</p>
<p>I could go on much, much longer about the upsides of the International School of Beijing. It pushed me academically, while also giving me the freedom to follow what I was really interested in. However, this blog post
would be nothing without the other side.</p>
<h3>Public School</h3>
<p>This summer I moved from Beijing, China to Palo Alto, California. This move was super unexpected, I found out I was moving after school had already let out for the summer. It took around 5 days for the decision to be finalized, and I was
in California later that same month. One of the implications of this move would be transitioning from the international schools which I had grown so accustomed to, to a public American high school.</p>
<p>Public American high schools were spoken of at my time as ISB of places any of us would struggle to function. From the higher class sizes, to more competitive sports teams, they couldn't be more different. Now, public high schools come in all shapes
and sizes, just like the international school's I've been to. My views may be a bit skewed as I attend Gunn High School, which probably isn't representative of the average public school (Gunn is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-public-high-schools/s/california/">ranked number 1</a>
in California).</p>
<p>ISB is very, very predominately Asian (~95%). Gunn isn't quite there, but Asian/Asian-Americans comprise around 40-50% of the student body, making them almost a majority. This didn't take so much
getting used to after ISB, but I've noticed a few subtle differences. The biggest being the difference in pronunciation of Chinese last names (such as Zhou being pronounced 'zao' instead of 'joe').</p>
<p>My class sizes now are much larger, with 32 person classes not being too out of the ordinary. This took me a while to get used to (last year my Chinese class had four people). The lack of teacher-student
interaction is definitely apparent, and it's simply a different learning environment. Asking questions is still possible, but getting lots of 1-1 time with the teacher is almost impossible.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="AP vs IB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/apib.jpg" /></p>
<p>I've also noticed that although AP is meant to be the IB's domestic counterpart, things are taught in a very different way. One of my main complains about AP Economics earlier this year was the testing style -
everything is multiple choice. In theory this should make it easier to study, but it ended up making me feel claustrophobic in a way, because there's no way to justify your answer if it doesn't match the letter
on the answer key.</p>
<p>There is almost a much heavier emphasis on rote memorization in the American school system, from what I've seen. What this results in is students who cram material before tests, just to have it all leave their brains
after whatever test/quiz they were studying for. I've found that I much prefer the IB's emphasis on discussion, and really <em>learning</em> the content, not just memorizing it.</p>
<p>Both Gunn and ISB are competitive environments, there's no doubt about that. However, I've found that students at Gunn (on average) seem to be under more stress (the source of which I can
only speculate, but I wouldn't rule parents out). Compare this to ISB where students are undoubtedly also pressured academically, however I think much more of that comes from within, rather than external forces.</p>
<p>With regard to the athletics aspect, I've found that although Gunn is an American public school, athletics aren't exactly on the top of everyone's mind. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that
football, the most popular high school sport, is a no-cut sport (meaning anyone can be on the team), whereas sports like badminton have stiff competition to make the squad. Sports practices also last for around 3 hours a day,
every weekday which was a big change for me, because ISB sports practices only take around two and a half hours a day, three days a week.</p>
<p><img class="article_image" alt="I got to play football at Gunn" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/fball.jpg" /></p>
<p>If I had to pick between Gunn and ISB, it would be tough. ISB definitely has nicer facilities and a tighter-knit community, but Gunn has the advantage of being much larger, making it easier to explore any
somewhat unconventional interests you may have. Relating to this, Gunn is a much, much better school for anything involving technology (I guess this isn't much of a surprise, seeing as it's located smack-dab in
Silicon Valley). ISB's only programming course (as far as I'm aware) is 'Web Design for Clients', which I've been told isn't the most extensive course in the world. Gunn has an entire Computer Science pathway in the
course guide, but I've found that students I've met are by far the most valuable resource in terms of all things computer science. Any question I can't answer by Googling can be quickly resolved by one of the many
people I know. This has been especially helpful in my foray into machine learning (and web design, as evidenced by this site's existence).</p>
<h3>University and Beyond</h3>
<p>Although I have not received my college decisions yet, the question of private vs public universities still looms in my mind. The University of California system has the obvious advantage (to me) of being in California,
as well as being coupled with in-state tuition. However, this comes at the expense of an over-crowded university, and limited opportunity to really get to know your professors until later years. Private universities on the other hand,
although much more expensive, place a heavier emphasis on the undergraduate experience, as well as generally nicer campuses. Of course, take all of this with a grain of salt because this is all just what I've read and heard from
other people, I haven't really had the opportunity to find these things out for myself (yet).</p>

        var chinese = '<p>在我生命的前18年，我很幸运能够在我的K-12年中体验到两种主要类型的学校。我将首先简要介绍一下我在各自的经验，然后讨论更具体的差异，最后我对两者之间的选择有何看法。 </p><p><img class="article_image" alt="图像" src="https://articles.niche.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/private-vs-public-schools.png" /></p><p>马上我应该注意到，我从未参加过你可能会想到的那种私立学校。我去过的所有&#39;私立&#39;学校都是国际学校，根据定义它们是私立的，但也有更广泛的用途。 </p><p>我在瑞典马尔默的<a target="_blank" href="http://bism.bladins.se/">布莱丁</a>国际学校开始了我的学业生涯。这只是一个月左右，所以我没有太多的补充。 </p><p>从幼儿园第二个月到中学到四年级，我参加了德克萨斯州伍德兰兹的一所公立小学。这还是一段时间以前，所以我现在没有太多想法。也许我留下的印象是（根据Facebook），现在我的很多朋友现在都<em>大量</em>参与学校游行乐队，但我真的认为这比得上公立/私立学校更像德克萨斯的事情。 </p><h3>私立学校</h3><p>现在到更有趣的部分（即我清楚地记得我的生活时期）。我完成了小学，并在<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oslointernationalschool.no/">奥斯陆国际学校</a>完成了中学的全部<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oslointernationalschool.no/">课程</a> 。这所学校<em>很小</em> ，我的全班成绩约为40名学生。对于一些人来说，如此小的班级规模有时会出现幽闭恐惧症。这个小环境的积极意义在于，你可以很好地认识身边的每个人。缺点是你<em>真的</em>很了解每个人。作为OIS的学生，我的课程选择从来没有太多选择，除了挪威语（我选择西班牙语）外，我唯一真正的选择是外语。 </p><p>每个年级的结构都有三个“联系”班级（将其视为班级）。在传统的挪威时尚，我们留在这些小组为所有我们的类（除外语）。这些团体每年都会改变，但挪威的学校通常都会在同一班级上班十二年。 OIS是一所真正的国际学校，大约四分之一的学生是挪威学生，其余四分之三来自世界各地，来自南非，澳大利亚，特立尼达和巴基斯坦等国家。 </p><p>作为一所私立学校的OIS有一些非常好的设施，但在边缘也有些粗糙。我遗留下来的遗留物正在搞乱在地面上烧了一个洞的化学实验，截至2017年6月（事件发生3年后），这个洞依然存在。尽管这是一所私立学校，但它是世界上最昂贵的国家之一，可以完成任务。这就是说，它在<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/W. B. Samson - Bekkestua pizza near stabekk akershus norway/@59.9174764,10.5872009,21z?hl=en">Bekkestua的</a>位置对于一个中学生来说可能不是那么方便。 </p><p>我可能错过的最多关于学校的是我们每年要参加的为期一周的多级短途旅行。虽然我们一直呆在挪威境内，但我们有机会在山上滑雪，在峡湾航行，然后徒步穿越森林。挪威以自然为中心的观点通过这些旅行绝对闪耀。 </p><p>在8至9年级的夏季，我从OIS搬到了北京国际学校<a target="_blank" href="https://www.isb.bj.edu.cn/">ISB</a> 。 ISB与OIS完全不同，我真的不知道会发生什么。第一个明显的区别是我有一个学校任命的“同伴帮手”在我抵达北京之前与他聊天。我可以问她关于学校的任何问题，或者一般的中国问题。在我看来，这是超级有用的，有利于轻松过渡到一个全新的国家。 </p><p><img class="article_image" alt="OIS与ISB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/schools.png" /></p><p> ISB的学生人数是OIS的3倍以上，远远超过了3倍的足迹。校园很大，几乎像一所小型大学。我的成绩几乎翻了一番，达到了110左右，但有趣的是，我的实际班级规模似乎保持不变，有些甚至缩小（我的中文班有4名学生在某一点上）。这是（显然），因为我们作为学生有更多的选择，关于我们可以采取的选择。这种自由让我可以在摄影和电影中选修两门，如果不是这些选修课，我可能从未发现过两件事。这是一所私立学校，它显示了。每个老师都热衷于他们的主题， <em>并</em>擅长教授它。无论是电影室，举重室，体育馆还是摄影工作室，这些设施都是一流的。我们作为学生也被允许对这些设施进行免费统治，我们从不需要预订或预订。 </p><p> ISB尽管仍然是国际学校，但是远远低于OIS的国际水平。全班绝大多数是中国人（或华裔美国人/加拿大华人）和韩国人。只有少数外籍人士与我的情况类似，其中大部分是在北京，因为他们的父母曾在美国大使馆工作。 </p><p>我不再需要一整周的时间来参加我的整个年级，但是我现在有机会参加国际体育运动。斯堪的纳维亚国际学校<em>确实</em>参加体育运动，但每年只进行一次，通常每次都需要8小时的巴士。亚洲国际学校的体育旅行总体上处于“另一层次”。无论是去上海还是一直到马尼拉，我们几乎都会飞。这些旅行中我最喜欢的一个方面是，我们没有留在酒店房间，而是有一个“寄宿家庭”系统。从本质上讲，我和一个队友会睡在主人队场上的某个人身上。这听起来很不起眼，有时候也是如此，但它是结识来自大陆各地不同学校的新人的好方法。 </p><p>学校在这里不容易。这是我一生中第一次不得不为了测试而学习。如果你看看我的高中成绩单，很明显，9年级我花了一些时间来适应这一点。最终，我认为这是非常有价值的，我必须学习<em>如何</em>学习。在高中学习比在大学学习要好得多。在OIS学校相对而言是冷漠的，除非那种驱动力来自你自己，否则没有真正的动力去做好。无论是好还是坏，这种驱动力在ISB都是外部化的，但以一种健康的方式。尽管我们会互相帮助学习，但我们大多数人总是在我们心中留下“曲线”。虽然这一切都很好。 </p><p>关于北京国际学校的好处，我可以继续努力。它在学术上促使我学习，同时也让我有自由去关注我真正感兴趣的东西。然而，如果没有对方的话，这篇博客文章将毫无用处。 </p><h3>公立学校</h3><p>今年夏天，我从北京搬到了加利福尼亚的帕洛阿尔托。这一举动超乎意料之外，我发现放学后已经放弃了这个夏天。大约需要5天的时间才能完成决定，并在同一个月晚些时候在加利福尼亚州。这一举措的影响之一将是从我习以为常的国际学校转变为公立的美国高中。 </p><p>公共美国高中在我那个时候被说出来，因为ISB我们任何一个人都会努力工作。从更高的班级规模到更具竞争力的运动队，他们不可能有更多的不同。现在，公立高中有各种形状和大小，就像我去过的国际学校一样。当我参加Gunn高中时，我的看法可能有点偏差，这可能不是普通公立学校的代表（Gunn在加利福尼亚州<a target="_blank" href="https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-public-high-schools/s/california/">排名第一</a> ）。 </p><p> ISB主要是亚洲国家（〜95％）。冈恩并不在那里，但亚裔/亚裔美国人约占学生团体的40-50％，使他们几乎占多数。这在ISB之后并没有太多适应，但我注意到了一些细微的差别。最大的差异在于中国姓氏的发音（例如周宣称&#39;zao&#39;而不是&#39;joe&#39;）。 </p><p>现在我的班级规模要大得多，有32个班的班级不会太过分。这让我花了一段时间去习惯（去年我的中文课有四个人）。缺乏师生互动是显而易见的，它只是一个不同的学习环境。提出问题仍然是可能的，但与老师大量的1-1时间几乎是不可能的。 </p><p><img class="article_image" alt="AP vs IB" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/apib.jpg" /></p><p>我也注意到，尽管美联社是国际文凭组织的国内同行，但事情的教学方式却非常不同。我今年早些时候对AP Economics的主要抱怨之一是测试风格 - 一切都是多种选择。从理论上讲，这应该让学习更容易，但最终会让我感到幽闭恐惧，因为如果答案与答案中的字母不匹配，则无法证明答案是正确的。 </p><p>从我看到的情况来看，在美国学校系统中对死记硬背的重视几乎要重得多。这些结果会导致学生在考试前塞满材料，只是为了让他们在所有考试/测验中都留下他们的大脑。我发现我更喜欢IB强调讨论，并真正<em>学习</em>内容，而不仅仅是记住它。 </p><p> Gunn和ISB都是竞争环境，毫无疑问。但是，我发现Gunn的学生（平均而言）似乎处于更多的压力之下（我只能推测这些压力的来源，但我不会排除父母）。与ISB相比，学生无疑在学术上也受到压力，但我认为更多的是来自内部，而不是外部力量。 </p><p>关于田径方面，我发现尽管冈恩是美国的一所公立学校，但田径运动并不是每个人心目中的顶峰。这一点从最受欢迎的足球这一事实可以清楚地证明高中运动是一项不可缺少的运动（意味着任何人都可以加入），而像羽毛球这样的体育运动对于球队来说有着激烈的竞争。每周工作日的体育活动也持续3小时左右，这对我来说是一个很大的改变，因为ISB体育活动每周三天，每天只需要两个半小时。 </p><p><img class="article_image" alt="我在冈恩踢足球" src="https://ethanhouston.com/img/articles/fball.jpg" /></p><p>如果我不得不在Gunn和ISB之间选择，那将很困难。 ISB绝对拥有更好的设施和更紧密的社区，但是Gunn拥有更大的优势，更容易探索你可能拥有的任何有些非常规的兴趣。与此相关的是，Gunn是一个非常好的学校，涉及技术领域（我猜这并不令人意外，因为它位于硅谷）。 ISB唯一的编程课程（据我所知）是&#39;Web Design for Clients&#39;，据我所知，它不是世界上最广泛的课程。 Gunn在课程指南中有完整的计算机科学方向，但是我发现我所遇到的学生是计算机科学领域最宝贵的资源。任何我无法通过谷歌搜索回答的问题都可以通过我认识的许多人之一迅速得到解决。这对我进入机器学习（以及网站设计，本网站存在的证据）特别有帮助。 </p><h3>大学和超越</h3><p>虽然我还没有收到我的大学决定，但私立大学和公立大学的问题仍然笼罩在我的脑海。加利福尼亚大学系统对加利福尼亚州有明显的优势（对我来说），同时还有州内学费。然而，这是以过度拥挤的大学为代价的，在晚年才有机会真正了解你的教授。另一方面，私立大学虽然要贵得多，但更重视本科生的经历以及更好的校园。当然，所有这些都需要一点盐，因为这些都是我从其他人那里阅读和听到的，我还没有真正有机会为自己找到这些东西（还）。 </p>';
