This is my site that I've hand-coded. The site is built off of a templating
system, where I write my articles and other pieces of text in either JSON or Markdown format,
and then I run a *build.py* file that I've created which parses the text, and appropriately
creates HTML files from the templates.

The current design is a work in progress, and I'm always trying to make the website 
better looking, optimize its performance, as well as improving my writing skills.

The website is hosted for free on Github Pages, with the only thing I paid for
being the domain name I bought from Hover.
