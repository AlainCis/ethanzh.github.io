ISB has over 3 times as many students as OIS, and well over 3 times the footprint. The campus is huge, almost like a small university. The size of my grade almost tripled to around 110, but interestingly, my actual class sizes
seemed to stay the same size, and some even shrunk (I had 4 students in my Chinese class at one point). This is (somewhat obviously) because we as students had far more choice with regards to
the choices we could take. This freedom allowed me to take electives in photography and film, two things I probably never would have discovered if not for these electives. This was a private school, and it showed. Every teacher
was passionate about their subject *and* great at teaching it. The facilities, whether it be the film room, weight room, gymnasiums, or photography studios, were all top-notch. We as students were also allowed free-reign over
these facilities, we never had to book-ahead or make reservations.

ISB, despite still being an international school, was far less international than OIS. An overwhelming majority of the class was Chinese (or Chinese-American/Chinese-Canadian) and Korean. There were only a small number of
expats in a similar situation as me, and most of them were in Beijing because their parents worked for the United States embassy.

I no longer got to go on week-long trips with my whole grade, but what I now had the opportunity to go on international sports trips. Scandinavian international schools *do* go on sports trips, but it's only once a year, and it
normally involved a 8-hour bus trip each way. Sports trips at Asian international schools are on a whole 'nother level. We would almost always fly, whether it be to Shanghai, or all the way down to Manilla. One of my favorite aspects of
these trips was that we didn't stay in hotel rooms, we instead had a 'homestay' system. Essentially, me and a team mate would sleep on someone from the host team's floor. It sounds unglamorous, and sometimes it was, but it was a great way to
meet new people from different schools around the continent.

School wasn't easy here. For the first time in my life I actually had to study for tests. If you look at my high school transcript, it's quite obvious that 9th grade me took some time to get used to this. Ultimately,
I think it is very valuable that I had to learn *how* to study. It's a lot better to have to learn that in high school than in university. At OIS school was relatively nonchalant, and there wasn't really a drive to
do well unless that drive came from yourself. For better or for worse, that drive is externalized at ISB, but in a healthy way. Even though we would help each other study, most of us always had 'the curve' at the back
of our minds. It was all in good spirit, though.

I could go on much, much longer about the upsides of the International School of Beijing. It pushed me academically, while also giving me the freedom to follow what I was really interested in. However, this blog post
would be nothing without the other side.
